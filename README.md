# Pure NodeJs MVC
## Wonderful Pizza: America's Most Wanted Pizza
I wanted to relearn the basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript,and NodeJs) so I decided to build
a website or web application for some fictional pizza delivery company I called Wonderful Pizza: America's Most Wanted Pizzas. I had one single rule in mind when building this personal project. And the number one rule is: No npm, no dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries,no CDNs, and no copying and pasting someone else's codes. So the whole project was built from scratch, from an empty folder. The basis of the project are:
1. Front End: vanilla HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla Javascript. No npm, no dependencies, no package.json, no frameworks, no libraries, and no CDNs.
2. Back End: vanilla JavaScript and pure NodeJs: No npm, no dependencies, no package.json, no frameworks, and no libraries


### Composition
## Front End
1. CSS, CSS-Grid
2. Javascript
3. Web Component
## Back End: API
1. Token base
2. Routing
## Back End: CLI
1. authentication
2. Administration
### Notes: 
This project uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) heavily. By Object Oriented Programming I mean Object Oriented Programming the Javascript way and specifically the ES6 way. And by Functional Programming I mean functional programming the Javascript way; specifically the ES6 way.

All the front end codes and all the classes of the front end codes inherit a single class or interface: 
```javascript
HTMLElement
```
All the backend codes and all the classes of the backend code inherit a single NodeJs API class:

```javascript
 EventEmitter
```
### installation
1. clone the repository:
 ```javascript
 git clone https://github.com/devoutprogrammer/raw_nodeJs_mvc_wonderful_pizza.git mvc
```
2. cd in the directory:
```javascript
cd mvc
```
3. run the command:
```javascript
 node index
```
